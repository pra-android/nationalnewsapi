owning to the fact it has its own version of a nervous system.Currently, cargo-carrying drones are required to make regular pitstops for manual safety checks, which limit their use and and increase operating costs.But experts from the University of Southampton have created a drone with an optical fibre system, which researchers said can monitor its own health just like the body's nervous system.The team said the technology would make future drones more reliable and cost-effective.The system uses a unique technique called optical speckle, which projects specific images dependant on what the optical fibre nervous system feels.","imageUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ed4a/live/06d773c0-9855-11ef-8ac6-ed68aa865ecb.jpg.webp","publishedOn":"07/11/2024 at 04:19 PM","publishedBy":"Sanjeeb Ghimire","__v":0},{"_id":"672c982b23b7d2f372c6f2c2","id":"672c982b23b7d2f372c6f2c1","title":"University AI experts help teachers in Vietnam","description":"Researchers at Coventry University are using artificial intelligence (AI) to help teachers more than 6,000 miles away.Educators in rural communities in northern Vietnam face challenges with limited technology and training, experts say.Now a team led by Dr Petros Lameras has launched GameAid, a project which shows teachers how they can use generative AI to their benefit.Dr Lameras said he believed the project, which uses a game to show teachers how to use AI, was crucial.We are not just enhancing skills but fundamentally changing how educators engage with technology in the classroom, he said.Generative AI, also known as Gen AI, is capable of creating text, images, speech, music, video and code in response to prompts from a user.Urban areas in Vietnam tend to have better access to technology and educational resources compared to rural regions.Coventry researchers believe AI can be used to help provide educational materials, improve student learning outcomes and bridge the gap between educators from under-represented groups.","imageUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d518/live/5ad8f570-96c0-11ef-be73-83da5bc7e5f3.jpg.webp","publishedOn":"07/11/2024 at 04:21 PM","publishedBy":"Sanjeeb Ghimire","__v":0},{"_id":"672c988623b7d2f372c6f2c5","id":"672c988623b7d2f372c6f2c4","title":"Apple's AI features roll out on iPhones -

each image will be reviewed by a healthcare professional.NICE says broken bones are missed in 3-10% of cases - it is the most common diagnostic error in emergency departments.And the trained experts who perform and analyse thousands of X-ray images every day in the NHS are in short supply, with a huge workload.Vacancy rates are 12.5% for radiologists and 15% for radiographers, according to the long-term plan for the NHS in England.The solution, according to NICE, is to harness the power of AI to work alongside clinicians.","imageUrl":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3a84/live/70738b10-9018-11ef-b5ce-bffc7f4019a7.jpg.webp","publishedOn":"07/11/2024 at 04:29 PM","publishedBy":"Sanjeeb Ghimire","__v":0}]}
